Rift Production Tool

### Product Description
Rift Production Tool is a tailored multi-functional tool, used to give a better experience for League of Legends tournaments.
In first instance it will use the Spectator API to collect and return to a web-application the pick & ban phase of livestreamed matches of a tournament, in order to show said phase off through an aesthetically fitting interface.
The second instance is the usage of the Tournament API, to automatically prepare the game lobbies to make it easier for both the organizers and for the players, and also to collect the data related to the tournament's games, in order to show off for example, exemplar performances from players or overall statistics before important matches.
The tool would be used by Rift Entertainment asbl. a Luxembourg based non-profit organization (asbl.), providing high quality livestreaming services in Luxembourg and its surroundings, but also on a mission to provide overall entertainment to the people. We've already produced the show of a League of Legends tournament, and also being fans of the game we wish to further improve our production quality,  and our own potential tournaments, by using this tool.
